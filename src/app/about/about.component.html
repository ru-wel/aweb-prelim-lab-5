            <p class="mb-5">In 1993, Holy Angel University (HAU) launched its first 2-year Associate Program in Computer Technology, followed by government recognition in 1995. The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), under Dean Liwayway Perez and Chairperson Carlo Sunga, later introduced the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) in 1996. Over the years, the university expanded its offerings with programs such as the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) and Information Management (BSIM) in 2000. By SY 2008-2009, the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) began offering specialized tracks in Systems Development, Network Administration, and Multimedia Technology. The college also moved to the newly constructed Saint Joseph Hall (SJH) in 2010, which houses state-of-the-art computer laboratories and classrooms to accommodate the growing student population.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">The School of Computing (SoC) at HAU aims to meet the diverse needs of the IT industry by producing skilled graduates in fields such as software development, cybersecurity, multimedia, and data analytics.
